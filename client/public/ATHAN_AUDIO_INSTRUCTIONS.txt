ATHAN AUDIO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

To enable Athan sound notifications, you need to add an Athan audio file:

1. DOWNLOAD ATHAN AUDIO:
   - Find a high-quality Athan MP3 file (30-60 seconds)
   - Recommended: Traditional Mecca Athan or Medina Athan
   - Sources: Islamic websites, mosque recordings, or audio libraries

2. FILE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Format: MP3
   - Name: exactly "athan.mp3" (lowercase)
   - Location: /client/public/athan.mp3
   - Duration: 30-60 seconds recommended
   - Quality: 128kbps or higher

3. INSTALLATION:
   - Place the athan.mp3 file in this directory (/client/public/)
   - Restart your development server
   - Test using the "Test Sound" button in the prayer times page

4. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Ensure you have rights to use the audio file
   - Many Islamic organizations provide free Athan recordings

The notification system is already implemented and will work once you add the audio file.
